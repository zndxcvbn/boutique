## Installation

## Quick Start

### Creating Outfit Distributions

3. **Add Entry**: Click "Add Entry" to create a new distribution rule
4. **Select Outfit**: Choose the outfit you want to distribute from the dropdown
5. **Add Filters**: Use the NPCs, Factions, Keywords, or Races tabs to add targeting filters
6. **Save**: Choose a filename and click "Save File"

### Using the NPC Browser to Build Filters

1. Go to **Distribution > NPCs** tab
2. Use the filter dropdowns (Gender, Unique, Faction, Race, Keyword) to narrow down NPCs
3. The filtered list shows exactly which NPCs will be affected
4. Click **Copy Filter** to save your current filter criteria
5. Switch to the **Create** tab and click **Paste Filter** to apply it to an entry

### Patching Armor Stats

1. Go to the **Armor Patch** tab

3. Select the mod with desired stats as the Target Plugin (e.g., Requiem.esp)
4. Map source armors to target armors using "Map Selection"

## Building from Source

1. Install [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
2. Clone this repository
3. Open terminal in the project folder
4. Run: `dotnet build`
5. Run: `dotnet run`

Or open `Boutique.csproj` in Visual Studio 2022 / Rider and build.

## Publishing

Run the PowerShell script to produce a ready-to-ship single-file EXE:

```powershell
pwsh scripts/publish-win.ps1
```

This creates a framework-dependent build (~80MB) that requires .NET 8 Desktop Runtime.

Add `-SelfContained` for a larger (~220MB) standalone build that bundles the .NET runtime:

```powershell
pwsh scripts/publish-win.ps1 -SelfContained
```

Outputs land in `artifacts/publish/<runtime>/`.

## Distribution File Formats

### SPID (Spell Perk Item Distributor)

SPID uses `*_DISTR.ini` files in your Data folder. Example syntax:

```ini
Outfit = MyCustomOutfit|ActorTypeNPC|BanditFaction|NONE|F|NONE|100
```

This distributes `MyCustomOutfit` to female NPCs with the `ActorTypeNPC` keyword who are in `BanditFaction`.

### SkyPatcher

SkyPatcher uses INI files typically in `Data/skse/plugins/SkyPatcher/`. Example syntax:

```ini
filterByFactions=Skyrim.esm|0001BCC0:filterByGender=female:outfitDefault=MyMod.esp|FE000D65
```

Boutique can generate both formats from the same filter configuration.
